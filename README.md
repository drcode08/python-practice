**Learn-Python — Social Coding & Knowledge Sharing**

Welcome to the Learn-Python project — a friendly, hands-on collection of examples and notebooks designed for social coding and knowledge sharing. This repository gives clear, practical Python knowledge so readers can progress from beginner to programmer.

**What This Project Is**:
- **Purpose:** Teach Python through readable examples and interactive notebooks.
- **Audience:** Beginners, self-learners, students, and anyone wanting a practical path to programming.
- **Approach:** Bite-sized scripts, explanatory notebooks, and community contributions.

**Repository Structure**:
- **`basic_code/`**: Small, focused Python scripts demonstrating core concepts (variables, operators, control flow).
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration and exercises.
- **`concepts.txt`**: High-level concepts and quick notes.
- **`python_sets_examples.py`, `python_tuples_examples.py`**: Focused examples for specific data types.

Quick file links:
- [basic_code/data_types.py](basic_code/data_types.py)
- [basic_code/hello_world.py](basic_code/hello_world.py)
- [notebooks/lists.ipynb](notebooks/lists.ipynb)

Getting Started
- **Prerequisites:** Install Python 3.8+ and optionally Jupyter.

Run a small script:
```bash
python3 basic_code/hello_world.py
```

Open a notebook (recommended):
```bash
pip install jupyter
jupyter notebook notebooks
```

Recommended Learning Path
- **1.** Read `concepts.txt` for the overview.
- **2.** Run examples in `basic_code/` (start with `hello_world.py`, then `variables.py`, `data_types.py`).
- **3.** Explore related notebooks in `notebooks/` for interactive practice.
- **4.** Try small modifications and open a pull request to share improvements.

How to Contribute
- Fork the repo, make changes, and open a Pull Request.
- Suggest new examples, add explanations, or improve notebooks.
- Keep code clear, well-commented, and focused for learners.

Community Guidelines
- Be respectful and constructive in feedback.
- Write simple, clear examples and short explanations.

Next Steps
- Run the examples, try a notebook, and contribute your first small improvement.

If you want, I can:
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines.
- Add simple automated tests or a CI workflow to check examples.

Happy learning — become a programmer, one small example at a time.
